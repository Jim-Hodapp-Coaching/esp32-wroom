# esp32-wroom-rp
Rust-based Espressif ESP32-WROOM WiFi hardware abstraction layer for RP2040 series microcontroller.

Supports the [ESP32-WROOM-32E](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-wroom-32e_esp32-wroom-32ue_datasheet_en.pdf), [ESP32-WROOM-32UE](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-wroom-32e_esp32-wroom-32ue_datasheet_en.pdf) modules.

Future implementations will support the [ESP32-WROOM-DA](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-wroom-da_datasheet_en.pdf) module.
